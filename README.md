# MovieList

A site about my favourite films, built in Vue, TypeScript and Tailwind and bootstrapped with Vite.

## Building

- Designed a Figma prototype.
- Downloaded my data from Letterboxd in CSV.
- Converted CSV to JSON and added to project.
- Imported JSON on my home page and made a for loop through the data, using the "v-for" directive.
- Used Tailwind to style my content, making sure to keep it responsive.
- See Todo.md for what I'm working on next!np
